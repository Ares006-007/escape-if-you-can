Project Summary
Escape If You Can is a fast-paced arcade adventure game, blending reflex-driven gameplay with strategy and upgrades. Inspired by classic endless runners and modern escape-room mechanics, your goal is to continuously evade capture across procedurally generated environments, collecting coins, power-ups, and special vehicles that enhance the challenge and replay value.​

This game delivers instant action and tests both your dexterity and planning skills, all in a playful voxel art style. Whether you play for a few minutes or chase high scores for hours, every session offers new routes, hazards, and surprises.

Gameplay
Players awaken as a fugitive and must navigate a vibrant cityscape, dodging police units and environmental hazards. The escape is relentless—the longer you survive, the higher your wanted level, and the fiercer the opposition becomes.

Gameplay mechanics combine:

Reflex-based driving and maneuvering.

Resource management for unlocking upgrades.

Strategic selection of vehicles and power-ups.

Procedural generation to keep each run unpredictable.

Lost lives and collisions result in arrest or game over, but each round is a chance to improve your strategies and unlock further content.​

How To Play
Use A/D or ←/→ to steer your vehicle.

Avoid collisions with buildings, other cars, and environmental obstacles.

Spend collected coins to unlock new vehicles with different properties.

Gather gifts for bonuses and unique power-up effects.

Progress is tracked by score; longer escapes yield higher ranks and new unlocks.​

Game Over Conditions
Being caught or crashing ends your run. Review your score and learn from each attempt—replay to improve and climb the leaderboards.

Features
Multiple vehicle types: Each with unique handling and abilities.

Procedurally generated environments: Ensuring no two escapes are ever the same.

Increasing difficulty: More hazards, faster chases, and smarter opponents as your wanted level rises.​

Power-ups: Shields, speed boosts, jump pads, and slow-time effects.

Achievements and leaderboards: Track progress, challenge friends, and collect digital rewards.

All visual elements are crafted in a charming voxel style for accessibility and appeal.

Thematic Design
The game celebrates themes of freedom, resourcefulness, and consequence. Every decision—when to risk a shortcut, pick up a power-up, or swap vehicles—forms the core of your unique escape story. Police are both obstacle and motivator, pushing you towards ever-inventive solutions.

Narrative elements such as escape diaries, leaderboards, and unlockable "case files" deepen the world and offer humor and insight for returning players.

Technical Implementation
Escape If You Can is built with HTML5, JavaScript, and leverages a custom physics engine for smooth vehicle motion and collision detection. Implemented features include:

Dynamic level generation

Real-time input handling

Local storage for scores and achievements

Scalable UI for desktop and mobile play​

Lightweight codebase for quick loading and reliable performance

Core files:

index.html : Main entry point and UI frame.

script.js : Game logic (player actions, obstacles, power-ups, etc.).

README.md : This documentation.

Art Style & Inspirations
The game uses a bright, blocky voxel aesthetic inspired by titles such as Crossy Road and various Unity escape games. Influences include:

Endless runner classics

Escape-room logic design

Puzzle elements from indie and jam games

Pop culture reference to chase and pursuit genres

Character designs and environments pay homage to retro consoles and modern mobile games, blending nostalgia with current trends.

Level Design & Progression
Each play session creates a new cityscape layout, dotted with banks, skyscrapers, parks, and variable traffic. As the player's wanted level rises, additional barriers and smarter opponents appear.

Power-up placement is randomized but balanced for fair progression. Vehicle pick-ups encourage experimentation while not requiring specific purchases to succeed.

Strategy Tips
Early runs are best for learning controls and environment layouts.

Invest coins in vehicles optimized for speed or control, depending on your playstyle.

Use power-ups wisely: save shields for tricky intersections and speed boosts for the last stretch.

Avoid risky moves when police density is high—planning escapes through side streets can lower risk.

Replay levels to master patterns and climb the leaderboard.

Vehicles and Power-Ups
Vehicles vary in top speed, acceleration, and special abilities. Power-ups include:

Name	Effect	Duration
Shield	Absorbs 1 crash	10 seconds
Speed Boost	Doubles speed	5 seconds
Jump Pad	Leaps over obstacles	Single use
Slow Time	Halves enemy speed	8 seconds
Unlock additional types by spending cash or achieving high ranks.

Saving, Progress, and Achievements
Progress is auto-saved locally, tracking unlocked vehicles, high scores, and achievements. Leaderboards may be global or device-specific, encouraging friendly competition.

Achievements celebrate milestones such as "First Escape," "Master Driver," or "Collector," motivating ongoing exploration.

Installation
Local Play
Download project files.

Double-click index.html or open in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

Web Version & Platforms
Escape If You Can is optimized for browser play but can be ported to desktops or mobiles with minor modifications. Performance is best on modern browsers.

Tech Stack
Escape If You Can is developed using a robust yet accessible technology stack tailored for browser gameplay and easy extensibility. The following technologies and frameworks power the project:​

HTML5: Provides the structure for the game's user interface and canvas rendering.​

CSS3: Used for styling elements, loading screens, and UI overlays.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6): All game logic, controls, physics, and procedural generation are handled natively via JavaScript.​

Canvas API: Core graphics rendering for vehicles, environments, and animations.

Local Storage: Saves player data such as achievements, high scores, and unlocked vehicles securely in the browser.

Web Browser Environment: Game is designed for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, supporting both desktop and mobile platforms.

Optional external libraries: For extended UI elements and audio (where applicable).
